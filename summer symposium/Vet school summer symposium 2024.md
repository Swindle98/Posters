### Code



Want to run it yourself? I'm still actively developing the code, and it's  note ready for prime time yet, but when it is, it will be available  here:

https://github.com/Swindle98/Bovine_Long_ML

Eventually I envisage this beng a well documented suite of tools that other atttempting longitudinal studies can use to speed up  their research.
